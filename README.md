# LeetCoding-Challenge

## Purpose
 
This is a collection of **LeetCode Challenge Codes** which I am solving. I will be participatng in it and uploading my codes here. *Sincerity* is the truest form of *virtue*. 
LeetCoding Challenge allows you to show your consistancy and build up problem solving aptitute. I will be solving my codes in **C++** language.

## Thought
I believe in a simple equation : MISTAKES==LEARNING
My mistakes have taught me. I hope to grow while maintaining this. To make my codes more compact, understandable, simple and upto the mark.

There is always a scope of improvement , I am still learning and I don't think this process will ever stop.
